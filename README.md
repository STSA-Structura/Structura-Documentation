## Introduction

The Structura-Documentation repo is designed to provide a comprehensive resource for understanding the architectural framework and design choices of the project. It aims to facilitate collaboration, enhance code quality, and ensure consistency across the development process.

## Project Overview

- **Project Name:** Structura
- **Purpose:** Briefly explain what the project does and its primary objectives.
- **Technologies Used:** List the major technologies and frameworks used in the project.

## Architecture Guidelines

This section outlines the architectural principles and patterns that guide the project. Include topics such as:

- Layered Architecture
- Microservices
- Event-Driven Architecture
- Design Patterns

## Design Decisions

Here, document the key design decisions made during the project, along with the rationale behind them. Consider including:

- Reasons for selecting certain technologies
- Trade-offs considered
- Key design principles followed (e.g., SOLID, DRY)

## Documentation Structure

Explain how the documentation is organized within the repository. You may include information about:

- Folder structure
- Naming conventions
- Types of documents (e.g., API docs, user guides, technical specs)

## Getting Started

Provide instructions on how to clone the repository and set up the project locally. Include:

1. Prerequisites (e.g., software, libraries)
2. Cloning the repo
3. Installation steps
4. Running the project

```bash

### **Key Benefits**

1. **Centralized Learning**: Organizes all information under distinct architectural styles, with easy access to shared standards.
2. **Scalability**: Adding new architectures is straightforward without disrupting the existing structure.
3. **Cross-Architecture Insights**: Enables comparative insights across architectures, such as common deployment practices, coding standards, and performance tuning.
4. **Reusability**: Templates and shared guides provide a reusable foundation for future projects and configurations.
